You can contribute to exercises for register allocation by adding questions and/or solutions to this directory. You should follow the structure of `liveness-gcd.tex` and use commands from `commands.tex`. Note that the example in `liveness-gcd.tex` is not solved. Make sure that `pdflatex src/document.tex` produces a valid PDF document and open a pull request, when you are done.
